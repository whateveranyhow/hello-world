# make a .py named __init__ in a file named tests.



a skeleton has bin; 
               NAME(__init__.py); 
               tests(__init__.py and NAME_tests.py); 
               docs;
                setup.py

.cpy
before cd tests, enter nosetests(an installed whl file), will get .cpy.
it's like a compliled file to fasten the running speed.
